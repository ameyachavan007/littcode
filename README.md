## Angular Basics Learned for Project Implementation

In the process of implementing this project, the following Angular basics were learned and utilized:

#### TypeScript Basics
- **Union Types**: Combining multiple types into one type to allow for flexibility and versatility in data handling.
- **Built-in Types Type Guards**: Providing type safety and enabling conditional logic based on types during runtime.
#### RxJS Basics
- **Observable Lifecycle**: Understanding the lifecycle of observables and effectively managing asynchronous data streams.
- **RxJS vs Promises**: Comparing and contrasting RxJS observables with JavaScript promises for asynchronous programming paradigms.
#### Angular CLI
- **ng build**: Command used to compile the Angular application into an output directory for deployment.
- **ng serve**: Command used to serve the Angular application locally during development, enabling rapid iteration and testing.
- **ng generate**: Command used to generate Angular artifacts such as components, services, and modules to streamline development.
#### Templates
- **Interpolation**: Binding data values from the component to the template for dynamic rendering.
- **Property Binding**: Binding data from the component to HTML element properties for dynamic behavior.
#### Routing
- **Router Outlets**: Providing a placeholder in the template where the router dynamically renders the component based on the current route.
- **Router Links Guards**: Implementing guards to protect routes and control navigation based on authentication and authorization.
#### Forms
- **Reactive Forms**: Angular's reactive forms offer a model-driven approach to form handling, leveraging observables for dynamic and scalable form management.
#### Rendering Topics
- **Built-in Pipes**: Angular provides built-in pipes like DatePipe and CurrencyPipe for data transformation in templates, simplifying UI display.
- **Change Detection**: Angular's change detection system updates the UI to reflect data changes automatically, ensuring synchronization between data and view.
#### Miscellaneous
- **Services**: Encapsulating reusable functionality and data to promote modularity and maintainability.
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading modules and components asynchronously to improve application performance and reduce initial loading time.
- **Pipes**: Transforming data in the template for display purposes without altering the original data source.

These Angular basics were essential for building a robust and efficient application, enabling seamless user experiences and maintaining code quality and scalability.

## Features

- 🔐**User Authentication:**  Secure authentication system  using Google Auth to ensure user privacy and data integrity.
- 🆔**Unique Codes:** Each user receives a unique code upon signing in, which they can share with others to create problem-solving groups.
- 🛠️**Group Creation:** Users can easily create groups by sharing their unique codes with friends and colleagues.
- 👥💡**Collaborative Problem Solving:** Group members can collaborate on various problem-solving tasks and challenges.
- 📱💻**Responsive Design:** Built with Angular ang Angular Material, the application offers a responsive and user-friendly interface across different devices and screen sizes.
